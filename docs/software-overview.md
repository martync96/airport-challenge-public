# Overview

## Benefits

### Problem software is solving
The perceived problems that this software is solving seem to be the following:
- Automation. First and foremost as outlined by the clients requirements, there is a desire for this software to improve the currently implementation of air traffic control by automating the inflow and outflow of air traffic control. 
- Scalability. As the client has outlined a desire for the software to be able to overwrite capacities, there is an explicit implication that this software should be scalable and able to be changed to meet the needs of the current airport 

### Benefits it will bring
When discussing benefits the software will bring upon deployment, the main benefits are;
- Efficiency. The efficiency boost provided by this software is two-fold, firstly the automation of air traffic control in theory should allow for an increase of it's efficiency, due to the fact it will be done automatically. In addition to this, the scalable factor of the application will allow it to be deployed around a number of airports further increasing efficiency on a wide scale.
- Safety. Due to being able to cut out a lot of human error, there will be a decrease in the number of accidents that may happen due to said human error. 
- 24/7 Uptime. Due to the nature of software, it means that it will be able to run around the clock, meaning there needs to be no action in case of last sickness or unavailability of staff. Additionally, it means that air traffic controllers may not need to work night shifts which can have a higher chance of having accidents. 
- Cost-efficiency. The scalable aspect of the application ensures that it will be easy to deploy the software at other airports and means there is no need to for bespoke software for each deployment. 

### Risks
As with any software creation, there are a number of risks involved in developing it; 
- From a health & safety standpoint there are a number of risks involved, firstly, if there were any catastrophic errors with the software not functioning correctly it could lead to loss of life and resources, for example, if the software did not stop an airplane trying to land at an airport has no capacity to have any more planes.
- Reliability is another issue that always needs to be assessed when developing software, any downtime with the application could pose major disruption to airports and air traffic, resulting in financial losses, loss of customer loyalty and ruining peoples plans
- In the future, it should also be considered how the software will interact with unforeseen events such as accidents or breakdowns in the air forcing emergency re-routing of aircraft and the knock on effect this could have for air plane flow.
